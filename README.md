### Price Analysis
- Examine how much guests pay per room per night.
- Explore variations in the average daily rate (ADR) throughout the year.

### Demand Analysis
- Determine the busiest months with the highest number of guests to optimize pricing and promotions.
- Investigate the typical duration of stays, offering insights into preferences for short vs. long stays.

### Feature Engineering
- Select important numerical and categorical features to enhance model predictions.
- Apply mean encoding techniques for categorical variables.

### Outlier Management
- Manage outliers in the dataset to refine the accuracy of statistical models.

### Model Building
- Prepare data for training models.
- Implement logistic regression and other classification algorithms to predict outcomes based on cleaned and engineered features.
